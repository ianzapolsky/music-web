# Music Graph Visualizer

A web-based tool for visualizing connections between musical artists and albums using an interactive graph. The tool reads structured markdown files and creates a dynamic, zoomable, and draggable graph visualization.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph**: Zoom, pan, and drag nodes to explore relationships
- **Color-coded Relationships**:
  - ðŸ”µ Blue edges: Artist played on album
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple edges: Album samples another album
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green edges: Album covers another album
- **Node Types**: Different visual styles for artists (smaller circles) and albums (larger circles)
- **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed information about artists and albums
- **File Input**: Load multiple markdown files from a directory

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Load Markdown Files" and select a directory containing `.md` files
3. The graph will automatically generate and display the relationships
4. Use mouse to zoom, pan, and drag nodes
5. Hover over nodes to see detailed information
